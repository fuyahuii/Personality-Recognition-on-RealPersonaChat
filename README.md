# Enhancing Personality Recognition in Dialogue
This repo contains the implementation for the paper "Enhancing Personality Recognition in Dialogue by Data Augmentation and Heterogeneous Conversational Graph Networks" by Yahui Fu, Haiyue Song, Tianyu Zhao, and Tatsuya Kawahara.

## Overview
Our work focuses on improving personality recognition in dialogues, a critical aspect for enhancing human-robot interactions. The challenges addressed include the limited number of speakers in dialogue corpora and the complex modeling of interdependencies in conversations.

### Key Contributions:
1. **Data Augmentation for Personality Recognition:** We propose a novel data interpolation method for speaker data augmentation to increase speaker diversity.
2. **Heterogeneous Conversational Graph Network (HC-GNN):** A new approach to model both contextual influences and inherent personality traits independently.
